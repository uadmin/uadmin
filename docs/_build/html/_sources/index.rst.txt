Your First App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's build your first app which is a Todo list. First, we will create a folder for your project and prepare it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ cd ~/go/src/github.com/your_name/todo
    $ uadmin prepare
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/models
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/api
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/views
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/media
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/static
    [   OK   ]   Created: /home/abdullah/go/src/github.com/uadmin/todo1/templates

Use your favorite editor to create "main.go" inside that path. Put the
following code in "main.go".

.. code-block:: go

    package main

    import (
        "github.com/uadmin/uadmin"
        "time"
    )

    // Todo model ...
    type Todo struct {
	    uadmin.Model
	    Name        string
	    Description string `uadmin:"html"`
	    TargetDate  time.Time
	    Progress    int `uadmin:"progress_bar"`
    }

    func main() {
	    uadmin.Register(Todo{})
	    uadmin.StartServer()
    }


Now to run your code (Linux):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ go build; ./todo
    [   OK   ]   Initializing DB: [9/9]
    [   OK   ]   Initializing Languages: [185/185]
    [  INFO  ]   Auto generated admin user. Username: admin, Password: admin.
    [   OK   ]   Server Started: http://0.0.0.0:8080
             ___       __          _
      __  __/   | ____/ /___ ___  (_)___
     / / / / /| |/ __  / __  __ \/ / __ \
    / /_/ / ___ / /_/ / / / / / / / / / /
    \__,_/_/  |_\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/

In Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    > go build
    > todo
    [   OK   ]   Initializing DB: [9/9]
    [   OK   ]   Initializing Languages: [185/185]
    [  INFO  ]   Auto generated admin user. Username: admin, Password: admin.
    [   OK   ]   Server Started: http://0.0.0.0:8080
             ___       __          _
      __  __/   | ____/ /___ ___  (_)___
     / / / / /| |/ __  / __  __ \/ / __ \
    / /_/ / ___ / /_/ / / / / / / / / / /
    \__,_/_/  |_\__,_/_/ /_/ /_/_/_/ /_/

If you go to the explorer, you will notice that there are automatically generated **.key** and **.salt** files hidden in your computer. **.key** is used for authentication process to assure that the key of the user ("person A" for instance) held by "person B" belongs to the authenticated user which is "person A". **.salt** is extra salt added to password hashing. They add an extra security to your application. Once they have been deleted, no one can login to your application unless you use the recovery admin account that is automatically generated by your terminal.

Open your browser and type the IP address above. Then login using “admin” as username and password.
